\title{Evaluates model matrix}
\usage{
eval_design(modelmatrix, alpha, anticoef)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelmatrix}{The model matrix being evaluated}

\item{alpha}{The type-I error}

\item{anticoef}{The anticipated coefficients for calculating the power. If missing, coefficients will be generated with
gen_anticoef}
}
\value{
A data frame with the parameters, the type of power analysis, and the power
}
\description{
Evaluates design given a model matrix and returns
a data frame of parameter and effect powers.
}
\examples{
#generate the full factorial design for the factors in the model
factorial = expand.grid(a=c(-1,0,1),b=c(1,2,3,4),c=c(-1,1),d=c(-1,1))

#generate the designs
designlinear = gen_design(dategc,~a+b+c+d,10,"D",100)
designquadratic = gen_design(dategc,~(a+b+c+d)^2,15,"D",100)

#evaluate the design for a given alpha
eval_design(designlinear,alpha=0.05)
eval_design(designquadratic,alpha=0.05)

#generate the full factorial design for the factors in the model (with catagorical)
factorialmixed = expand.grid(a=as.factor(c(1,2,3,4,5,6)),b=c(1,0,-1),c=as.factor(c(1,2,3,4)),d=c(-1,1), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
mixeddesign = gen_design(factorialmixed,~a+b+c+d,18,"D",100)

#evaluate the design, with automatically computed anticipated coefficients (using gen_anticoef)
eval_design(mixeddesign,alpha=0.05)
#which is the same as this, but we are now explicitly entering the coefficients
eval_design(mixeddesign,alpha=0.05,c(1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,1,-1,1,1))

#evaluate the design, but with custom coeffients set for the most conservative effect power calculation
#(setting each level in the catagorical factor to zero except for the first)
eval_design(mixeddesign,alpha=0.05,c(1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1))
#which can also be written as:
eval_design(mixeddesign,alpha=0.05,gen_conservative_anticoef(mixeddesign))
