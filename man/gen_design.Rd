\arguments{
\item{candidateset}{A data frame of candidate test points; each run of the optimal design will be chosen (with replacement)
from this candidate set. Each row of the data frame is a candidate test point. Each row should be unique.
Usually this is a full factorial test matrix generated for the factors in the model unless there are disallowed combinations of runs.
Factors present in the candidate set but not present in the model are stripped out, and the duplicate entries in the candidate set are removed.
Disallowed combinations can be specified by simply removing them from the candidate set. Disallowed combinations between a
hard-to-change and an easy-to-change factor are detected by comparing an internal candidate set generated by the unique levels
present in the candidate set and the split plot design. Those points are then excluded from the search.
If a factor is continuous, its column should be type \code{numeric}. If a factor is categorical, its column should be type \code{factor} or \code{character}.}

\item{model}{The statistical model used to generate the test design.}

\item{trials}{The number of runs in the design.}

\item{splitplotdesign}{If `NULL`, a fully randomized design is generated. If not NULL, a split-plot design is generated, and
this argument specifies the design for all of the factors harder to change than the current set of factors.
Each row corresponds to a block in which the harder to change factors will be held
constant. Each row of \code{splitplotdesign} will be replicated as specified in \code{blocksizes},
and the optimal design is found for all of the factors given in the
\code{model} argument, taking into consideration the fixed and replicated hard-to-change factors. If \code{blocksizes} is missing,
`gen_design` will attempt to allocate the runs in the most balanced design possible,
given the number of blocks given in the argument `splitplotdesign` and the total number of `trials`.}

\item{blocksizes}{Default `NULL`. Specifies the block size(s) for design generation. If only one number is passed, `gen_design()`
will create blocks of the specified size, and if the total number of run specified in `trials` is not divisible by the number,
`gen_design()` will attempt to allocate the runs in the most balanced design possible. If a list is passed, each entry
in the list will specify an additional layer of blocking. If `splitplotdesign` is not `NULL`, this argument
specifies the number of subplots within each whole plot (each whole plot corresponding to a row in the `splitplotdesign` data.frame).}

\item{optimality}{Default "D". The optimality criterion used in generating the design. Full list of supported criteria: "D", "I", "A", "ALIAS", "G", "T", "E", or "CUSTOM". If "CUSTOM", user must also
define a function of the model matrix named customOpt in their namespace that returns a single value, which the algorithm will attempt to optimize. For
"CUSTOM" optimality split-plot designs, the user must instead define customBlockedOpt, which should be a function of the model matrix and the variance-covariance matrix. For
information on the algorithm behind Alias-optimal designs, see \emph{Jones and Nachtsheim. "Efficient Designs With Minimal Aliasing." Technometrics, vol. 53, no. 1, 2011, pp. 62-71}.}

\item{augmentdesign}{Default NULL. A dataframe of runs that are fixed during the optimal search process. The columns of augmentdesign must match those of the candidate set.
The search algorithm will search for the optimal `trials` - `nrow(augmentdesign)` remaining runs.}

\item{repeats}{Default `20`. The number of times to repeat the search for the best optimal design.}

\item{custom_v}{Default `NULL`. The user can pass a custom variance-covariance matrix to be used during blocked design generation.}

\item{varianceratio}{Default `1`. The ratio between the block and run-to-run variance for a given stratum in
a split plot/blocked design. This requires a design passed into `splitplotdesign`, so it will be overridden to `1`
if no split plot design is entered.}

\item{contrast}{Function used to generate the encoding for categorical variables. Default "contr.simplex", an orthonormal sum contrast.}

\item{aliaspower}{Default 2. Degree of interactions to be used in calculating the alias matrix for alias optimal designs.}

\item{minDopt}{Default 0.8. Minimum value for the D-Optimality of a design when searching for Alias-optimal designs.}

\item{parallel}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, the optimal design search will use all the available cores. This can lead to a substantial speed-up in the search for complex designs. If the user wants to set the number of cores manually, they can do this by setting options("cores") to the desired number. NOTE: If you have installed BLAS libraries that include multicore support (e.g. Intel MKL that comes with Microsoft R Open), turning on parallel could result in reduced performance.}

\item{timer}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, will print an estimate of the optimal design search time.}

\item{add_blocking_columns}{Default FALSE. The blocking structure of the design will be indicated in the row names of the returned
design. If TRUE, the design also will have extra columns to indicate the blocking structure. If no blocking is detected, no columns will be added.}

\item{randomized}{Default `TRUE`, due to the intrisic randomization of the design search algorithm. If `FALSE`,
the randomized design will be re-ordered from left to right.}

\item{advancedoptions}{Default `NULL`. An named list for advanced users who want to adjust the optimal design algorithm parameters. Advanced option names
are `design_search_tolerance` (the smallest fractional increase below which the design search terminates), `alias_tie_power` (the degree of the aliasing
matrix when calculating optimality tie-breakers), `alias_tie_tolerance` (the smallest absolute difference in the optimality criterion where designs are
considered equal before considering the aliasing structure),  `alias_compare`` (which if set to FALSE turns off alias tie breaking completely),
`aliasmodel` (provided if the user does not want to calculate Alias-optimality using all `aliaspower` interaction terms),
and `progressBarUpdater`` (a function called in non-parallel optimal searches that can be used to update an external progress bar). Finally, there's
`g_efficiency_method`, which sets the method used to calculate G-efficiency (default is "random" for a random Monte Carlo sampling of the design space,
"optim" for to use simulated annealing, or "custom" to explicitly define the points in the design space, which is the fastest method
and the only way to calculate prediction variance with disallowed combinations). With this, there's also `g_efficiency_samples`, which specifies
the number of random samples  (default 1000 if `g_efficiency_method = "random"`), attempts at simulated annealing (default 1 if `g_efficiency_method = "optim"`),
or a data.frame defining the exact points of the design space if `g_efficiency_method = "custom"`.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the run matrix for the optimal design. The returned data frame contains supplementary
information in its attributes, which can be accessed with the `get_attributes()` and `get_optimality()` functions.
}
\description{
Creates an experimental design given a model, desired number of runs, and a data frame of candidate
test points. \code{gen_design} chooses points from the candidate set and returns a design that is optimal for the given
statistical model.

\details{
Split-plot designs can be generated with repeated applications of \code{gen_design}; see examples for details.
